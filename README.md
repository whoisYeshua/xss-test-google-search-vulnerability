# Reflected XSS

This project demonstrates the danger of Reflected XSS attacks. There are 4 inputs:

1. Uses insecure `innerHTML` - _unsafe_
2. Uses secure `textContent` - _supersafe_
3. Uses sanitization with `template` tag and exclusion of unsafe attributes (like [`DOMPurify`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)), but no more (exposed to the Reflected XSS attack that [Google Search had in 2018-2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG7U3fuNw3A&t=470s) and was [fixed here](https://github.com/google/closure-library/commit/c79ab48e8e962fee57e68739c00e16b9934c0ffa)) - _semisafe_
4. The problem of 3 points has been fixed, due to the use of `XMLSerializer` - _safe_
